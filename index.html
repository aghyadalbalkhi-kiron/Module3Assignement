   A large chicken (around 1.5kg/3lbs 5oz) will feed a family of four with leftovers for a salad or pasta dish the next day. A stock can be made from the carcass and turned into a risotto or broth on the third night. It's often considerably cheaper to buy a whole chicken and joint it yourself, than to buy ready-prepared breasts and leg joints. Whole chickens tend to be sold trussed (tied with string) - remove this and pull the legs gently away from the body to ensure even cooking. Sprinkling the skin with sea salt before roasting will help to crisp it up. Leave it to rest for 10 minutes after cooking, and before carving, and you'll be rewarded with a pool of flavoursome pan juices that can be served as they are, or thickened with a little flour and stretched with a splash of wine or stock for gravy A large chicken (around 1.5kg/3lbs 5oz) will feed a family of four with leftovers for a salad or pasta dish the next day.

   The origin of the name is unclear, with no definite connection to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.[1]

Leah Hyslop, writing in The Telegraph, observes that by the time Wellington became famous, meat baked in pastry was a well-established part of English cuisine, and that the dish's similarity to the French filet de bœuf en croûte (fillet of beef in pastry) might imply that "Beef Wellington" was a "timely patriotic rebranding of a trendy continental dish".[2] However, she cautions, there are no 19th century recipes for the dish. There is a mention of "fillet of beef, a la Wellington" in The Los Angeles Times of 1903, but the first occurrence of the dish itself is in the Oxford English Dictionary which cites a 1939 New York food guide with "Tenderloin of Beef Wellington" which is cooked, left to cool and rolled in a pie crust.[2]

Clarissa Dickson Wright argues that "This dish has nothing to do with that splendid hero, the Duke of Wellington; it was invented for a civic reception in Wellington, New Zealand, but it is a splendid addition to any party

     <div id="sushi.html" style="border: 2px solid red;" class="text-center"><h3>Sushi</h3>
  Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[1] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[2] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[3] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[4]

Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.

It was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[4] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[5][6]

The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[7][8] However, there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[9] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and QueriesSushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time.
